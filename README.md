# Regression in Convolution Neural Network Applied to Plant Leaf Count

<b><p align="justify">
Recent studies have shown that computer vision
techniques developed to boost the count of plant leaves brings
significant improvements. In this paper, a proposal was presented
for plant leaf counting using Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). To accomplish the training process, CNNs architectures
were adapted to solve regression problems. To evaluate the
proposed method, an image dataset with 810 images of three
species (Arabidopsis, Tobacco and one mutation) was used. The
results showed that Xception architecture obtained the best
results with R2 of 0.96 and MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.46.
